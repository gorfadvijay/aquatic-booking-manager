# 🚨 URGENT DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

## THE PROBLEM
Your edge functions are NOT deployed yet. That's why you're getting:
- ❌ 401 "Missing authorization header" 
- ❌ No database entries
- ❌ Payment verification loop

## THE SOLUTION
Deploy the updated edge functions RIGHT NOW.

## STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sbpswmrjgieicdxnjnhc/functions

### 2. Deploy create-payment-order Function
- Click "New Function" or edit existing
- Name: `create-payment-order`
- Copy the code from `supabase/functions/create-payment-order/index.ts`
- Click "Deploy Function"

### 3. Deploy verify-payment Function  
- Click "New Function" or edit existing
- Name: `verify-payment`
- Copy the code from `supabase/functions/verify-payment/index.ts`
- Click "Deploy Function"

### 4. Test Deployment
```bash
node test-deployment.js
```

**Expected**: Status 200 (not 401)

## AFTER DEPLOYMENT WORKS:
✅ Payment order creates database entry
✅ PhonePe payment works
✅ Payment verification finds record
✅ Bookings created in database
✅ Redirect to BookingSuccess page
✅ Complete end-to-end flow

## DEPLOY NOW! 🚀

The functions are ready, you just need to deploy them to Supabase.
